## Synoptic Project Year 2 - Group 70

# Setup Instructions

The software is made up of two components - the backend and the frontend

## Backend
To start the backend:
1. cd into the 'server' folder
2. run 'npm i'
3. run 'npm run start'

## Frontend
To start the frontend:
1. cd into the 'frontend' folder
2. run 'npm i'
3. run 'http-sever'

The frontend should now be displaying on port 8080.
